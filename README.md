# JSON-e

JSON-e is a data-structure parameterization system for embedding context in
JSON objects.

The central idea is to treat a data structure as a "template" and transform it,
using another data structure as context, to produce an output data structure.

There are countless libraries to do this with strings, such as
[mustache](https://mustache.github.io/). What makes JSON-e unique is that it
operates on data structures, not on their textual representation. This allows
input to be written in a number of formats (JSON, YAML, etc.) or even generated
dynamically. It also means that the output cannot be "invalid", even when
including large chunks of contextual data.

JSON-e is also designed to be safe for use on untrusted data. It never uses
`eval` or any other function that might result in arbitrary code execution. It
also disallows unbounded iteration, so any JSON-e rendering operation will
finish in finite time.
